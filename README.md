**This repo is *deprecated* and has been split into two, the [on-behalf-api](https://github.com/jimbol/on-behalf-api) and the [on-behalf-frontent](https://github.com/jimbol/on-behalf-frontend)**


OnBehalf
==================

It is almost common knowledge that our national lawmakers do not serve the American people, but rather, various corporate interests.  The goal of OnBehalf is to shine a light on corporations' influence on your representatives so that you can better interpret their actions.  Eventually, we'd like to draw a direct correlation between a lawmaker's contributors and their voting habits.

#Usage

##Request an individual legislator

Request by `id`

    this.store.find('legislator', {
        id: 'J000296'
    });

Calls

    /api/legislators/J000296

Which is the same as querying directly by `bioguide_id`

    this.store.find('legislator', {
        bioguide_id: 'J000296'
    });

Calls

    /api/legislators?bioguide_id=J000296


Find a user's reps based on address

    this.store.find('legislator', {
	    address: '1740 Washington Rd, MI'
    });
    // Returns all legislators for that address

Or zip code

	this.store.find('legislator', {
	    address: '60647'
    });
